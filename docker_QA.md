# What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable environments that bundle an application and all its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different systems. Docker helps developers to build, ship, and run applications more efficiently, isolating them from system-specific configurations.

In essence, Docker allows applications to run reliably in any environment, from development to production, by creating a consistent runtime environment.
